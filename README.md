# Description

Adds Victory Research 1-16. Each requires an insane amount of research to
complete. The difficult increases exponentially, with Victory Research 16
requiring 1 billion units.

# TODO

Make plaques that can be placed. Add them to the inventory when the research
is complete.

Note the # hours played before the research completes.

Put the research score on the score tab with the # rockets launched.

Add Victory Builds: 1,000,000 of a particular item builds into a victory build
plaque? Since the # resources need is a short int, I'd need to have it be the
sum of a build of components.

# Help

You can help by contributing icons for the plaques, both for the structures
and the inventory.
